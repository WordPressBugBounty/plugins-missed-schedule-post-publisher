🎯 Never miss scheduled posts again! Automatically detects and publishes missed scheduled posts on time, every time - perfect for low-traffic websites.

== Description ==

**Your Scheduled Posts, Published On Time - Guaranteed!**

Have you ever scheduled a post in WordPress, only to find it still sitting in "Missed Schedule" status hours or days later? You're not alone! This frustrating issue affects thousands of WordPress sites, especially those with low traffic.

Missed Schedule Post Publisher is the ultimate solution to WordPress's unreliable scheduling system. Install it once, configure your preferred check interval, and never worry about missed posts again!

### 🔴 The Problem: WordPress's Scheduling Flaw

WordPress doesn't use a true cron system to publish scheduled posts. Instead, it relies on **visitor activity** to trigger scheduled tasks. This means:

* **Low-traffic sites** can miss scheduled posts for hours or even days
* **Nighttime posts** may not publish until someone visits your site
* **Time-sensitive content** might go live too late to be effective
* **Editorial calendars** become unreliable and unpredictable

If your site doesn't get constant traffic, you're at risk of the dreaded "Missed Schedule" error.

### ✅ The Solution: Reliable, Automatic Publishing

Missed Schedule Post Publisher runs automatically at your chosen interval, checking for any posts that should have been published but weren't. When it finds them, it publishes them immediately—no manual intervention required!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 🤔 What exactly does this plugin do? =

The plugin automatically detects WordPress posts that were scheduled to be published but missed their publication time due to the "Missed Schedule" error. It then publishes these posts immediately, ensuring your content goes live as intended.

= ❓ Why do scheduled posts sometimes fail to publish in WordPress? =

WordPress uses a pseudo-cron system that relies on visitor activity to trigger scheduled tasks. If your site doesn't receive visits during the time a post is scheduled, WordPress may fail to publish it. This is especially common on:
* New or low-traffic websites
* Sites scheduling posts during off-peak hours
* Blogs with irregular visitor patterns
* Websites behind aggressive caching

= ⏱️ How often does the plugin check for missed posts? =

You have complete control! Choose from check intervals of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 60 minutes. Select the frequency that matches your publishing needs and traffic patterns.

= 🐌 Will this plugin slow down my website? =

No! The plugin is extremely lightweight and only performs a quick database query at your chosen interval. It's optimized for minimal resource usage and won't affect your site's loading speed or performance. Your visitors won't notice any difference.

= 📊 Does it affect my site analytics? =

Not at all. The plugin works in the background and doesn't generate additional page views or affect your analytics data. Your traffic statistics remain accurate.

= 📝 Does it work with custom post types? =

Currently, the plugin works with standard WordPress posts (the `post` post type). Support for custom post types may be added in future updates based on user feedback.

= 🚀 Can I use this on a high-traffic website? =

Yes, absolutely! While the plugin is designed primarily for low-traffic sites where the "Missed Schedule" problem is most common, it works perfectly on high-traffic websites too. It adds an extra layer of reliability to your publishing workflow.

= 🔧 How do I configure the plugin after installation? =

Simply go to **Settings → Missed Schedule Post Publisher** in your WordPress admin panel. Select your preferred check interval from the dropdown menu and click Save Settings. That's all you need to do!

= ⚙️ Does this plugin require WP-Cron to be enabled? =

The plugin integrates with WordPress's scheduling system for reliable execution. It works with standard WordPress installations and doesn't require special server configuration.

= 💾 Is it compatible with caching plugins? =

Yes! The plugin is compatible with all major caching plugins including WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, and others. It performs database checks that bypass the cache, ensuring missed posts are detected reliably.

= 🔄 What if I have a caching plugin with aggressive settings? =

The plugin should work fine, but if you're using very aggressive caching that caches database queries, you may need to exclude the plugin's checks from being cached. Contact your caching plugin's support for guidance on database query exclusions.

= 🛠️ The plugin isn't working - what should I do? =

Try these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check for missed posts**: Ensure you actually have posts with "Missed Schedule" status (go to Posts → All Posts and check the status)
2. **Verify settings**: Confirm the plugin is activated and configured with a check interval
3. **Clear cache**: If using a caching plugin, clear your cache completely
4. **Check for conflicts**: Temporarily disable other plugins to see if there's a conflict
5. **Plugin refresh**: Try deactivating and reactivating the plugin
6. **Check error logs**: Look at your WordPress debug log for any error messages
7. **Contact support**: If the issue persists, reach out via the support forum

= 🔐 Is this plugin secure? =

Yes! Version 1.0.5 includes major security improvements:
* Proper input sanitization and validation
* Nonce verification for all admin actions
* SQL injection protection using `$wpdb->prepare()`
* Capability checks for admin operations
* Built following WordPress security best practices

= 🌐 Can I translate this plugin to my language? =

Absolutely! The plugin is fully internationalized and ready for translation. You can use tools like Poedit or Loco Translate to create translations for your language.
